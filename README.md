## 📌 Task 1: Modeling Lounge Eligibility at Heathrow Terminal 3

### Objective

Determine which passengers are eligible to access British Airways lounges at Heathrow Terminal 3 based on flight, cabin, and loyalty status rules.

### Key Steps

* Understood lounge access policies and background context
* Defined eligibility assumptions
* Applied assumptions to flight schedules
* Built a structured **Lounge Eligibility Lookup Table**
* Justified each rule using clear business logic

### Files

* `Lounge_Eligibility_Lookup_and_Justification.xlsx` – Final lookup table with explanations
* `assumptions.md` – Eligibility assumptions
* `methodology.md` – Decision logic and approach

## 📌 Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour

### Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to complete a flight booking.

### Workflow

* Data exploration and cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Model training (Random Forest)
* Model evaluation (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Top-Decile Precision)
* Business-focused insights and recommendations

### Model Performance Highlights

* **ROC-AUC:** 0.79
* **PR-AUC:** 0.39
* **Top Decile Precision:** 43.8%
* **Conversion Uplift:** 2.9× over baseline

### Key Predictive Drivers

* Purchase lead time
* Length of stay
* Flight time preference
* Booking origin
* Route popularity
